# Trigger Animations

This project showcases an interactive animation where explosions are generated at the user's click location on the canvas. It creates a visually engaging effect with explosions that dynamically appear and disappear.

## Features

-   **Explosion Animation:** Each click on the canvas triggers a unique explosion animation with a random rotational angle.
-   **Sound Effects:** Each explosion is accompanied by a sound effect, adding to the immersive experience.
-   **User Interaction:** Allows the creation of multiple explosions by clicking at various points on the canvas.
